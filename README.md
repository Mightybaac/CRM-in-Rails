To organize a database for the CRM-in-Rails, you can follow these steps:

Run the command rake db:create to create the database for your application.
Run the command rake db:migrate to create the necessary tables in the database.
You can also use the command rake db:seed to seed your database with sample data if you want to test the functionality of your CRM.
You can create additional tables and relationships as necessary. For example, you may want to create a table for "Contacts" that has a one-to-many relationship with the "Customers" table.
You can also add any necessary indexes to your tables to improve the performance of your database.
Finally, you should test your database to ensure that it is functioning correctly.
It is important to keep in mind that the above steps and command are for a basic CRM Database and it is important to consider the data and functionality that you want to include in your CRM before organizing a database

Please note that, this is a general guide and will require additional configuration and customization to fit your specific needs.

This code is for a CRM program using Ruby on Rails. It uses the gem 'devise' for authentication and 'cancancan' for authorization. The code creates a new Rails application called "crm", generates a model and controller for customers, and installs and sets up Devise. The CustomersController is set up with standard CRUD actions and the views use forms to create and update customer information.
Please note that this code is not complete and would require additional setup and configuration in order to function properly.

This code displays a table of customers, showing their name, email, and phone. Each customer is displayed in a row, and each row has links to view the customer's information, edit the customer's information, and delete the customer.

You can also add other functionality like adding filters to search and sort the customer list, adding pagination, etc.

Please note that this is just a basic example of what the code for a CRM program built with Ruby on Rails might look like. There are many ways to implement a CRM and many different features that can be added, this code is only meant to give you a general idea of what it might look like.
