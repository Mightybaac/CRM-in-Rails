The following steps outline the process of setting up a CRM database using Ruby on Rails:

1. Create the database for your application by running rake db:create.

2. Create the necessary tables in the database by running rake db:migrate.

3. Optionally, you can seed your database with sample data by running rake db:seed.

4. Create additional tables and relationships as necessary, such as a "Contacts" table with a one-to-many relationship with the "Customers" table.

5. Add any necessary indexes to your tables to improve performance.

6. Test the database to ensure correct functionality.

The code is a Ruby on Rails application that provides a customer relationship management (CRM) system. The Gemfile lists the dependencies of the application, including the Devise and CanCanCan gems. In the terminal, a new Rails application named "crm" is created and then several models, controllers, and middleware are generated.

The CustomersController and NotesController manage the creation, updating, and destruction of customer and note records. The load_and_authorize_resource method provides authorization for CRUD operations on the resources through CanCanCan. The AuthorizationMiddleware class validates the authorization header of incoming requests. If the header is blank, the user will receive a 401 Unauthorized response.

The Ability class defines the authorization rules for the application using CanCanCan. It allows administrators to manage all resources, while other users can only access resources to read. The User model is generated with Devise and determines if a user is an admin by checking if the admin? method returns true. The Customer and Note models have validations to ensure the presence of certain attributes. The form view displays a form for creating and editing customer records.
